   "Hourly Precipitation Data (HPD) is digital data set DSI-3240, archived at the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC). The primary source of data for this file is approximately 5,500 US National Weather Service (NWS), Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and cooperative observer stations in the United States of America, Puerto Rico, the US Virgin Islands, and various Pacific Islands. The earliest data dates vary considerably by state and region: Maine, Pennsylvania, and Texas have data since 1900. The western Pacific region that includes Guam, American Samoa, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, and Palau have data since 1978. Other states and regions have earliest dates between those extremes. The latest data in all states and regions is from the present day. The major parameter in DSI-3240 is precipitation amounts, which are measurements of hourly or daily precipitation accumulation. Accumulation was for longer periods of time if for any reason the rain gauge was out of service or no observer was present. DSI 3240_01 contains data grouped by state; DSI 3240_02 contains data grouped by year.",

The GFS model is a coupled model, composed of four separate models (an atmosphere model, an ocean model, a land/soil model, and a sea ice model), which work together to provide an accurate picture of weather conditions. Changes are regularly made to the GFS model to improve its performance and forecast accuracy.

    "NOAA NEXt-Generation RADar (NEXRAD) Products"
   ]
  ],
  "Paragraph": [
   "This dataset consists of Level III weather radar products collected from Next-Generation Radar (NEXRAD) stations located in the contiguous United States, Alaska, Hawaii, U.S. territories and at military base sites. NEXRAD is a network of 160 high-resolution Doppler weather radars operated by the NOAA National Weather Service (NWS), the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and the U.S. Air Force (USAF). Doppler radars detect atmospheric precipitation and winds, which allow scientists to track and anticipate weather events, such as rain, ice pellets, snow, hail, and tornadoes, as well as some non-weather objects like birds and insects. NEXRAD stations use the Weather Surveillance Radar - 1988, Doppler (WSR-88D) system. This is a 10 cm wavelength (S-Band) radar that operates at a frequency between 2,700 and 3,000 MHz. The radar system operates in two basic modes: a slow-scanning Clear Air Mode (Mode B) for analyzing air movements when there is little or no precipitation activity in the area, and a Precipitation Mode (Mode A) with a faster scan for tracking active weather. The two modes employ nine Volume Coverage Patterns (VCPs) to adequately sample the atmosphere based on weather conditions. A VCP is a series of 360 degree sweeps of the antenna at pre-determined elevation angles and pulse repetition frequencies completed in a specified period of time. The radar scan times 4.5, 5, 6 or 10 minutes depending on the selected VCP. During 2008, the WSR-88D radars were upgraded to produce increased spatial resolution data, called Super Resolution. The earlier Legacy Resolution data provides radar reflectivity at 1.0 degree azimuthal by 1 km range gate resolution to a range of 460 km, and Doppler velocity and spectrum width at 1.0 degree azimuthal by 250 m range gate resolution to a range of 230 km. The upgraded Super Resolution data provides radar reflectivity at 0.5 degree azimuthal by 250 m range gate resolution to a range of 460 km, and Doppler velocity and spectrum width at 0.5 degree azimuthal by 250 m range gate resolution to a range of 300 km. Super resolution makes a compromise of slightly decreased noise reduction for a large gain in resolution. In 2010, the deployment of the Dual Polarization (Dual Pol) capability to NEXRAD sites began with the first operational Dual Pol radar in May 2011. Dual Pol radar capability adds vertical polarization to the previous horizontal radar waves, in order to more accurately discern the return signal. This allows the radar to better distinguish between types of precipitation (e.g., rain, hail and snow), improves rainfall estimates, improves data retrieval in mountainous terrain, and aids in removal of non-weather artifacts. The NEXRAD products are divided in two data processing levels. The lower Level II data are base products at original resolution. Level II data are recorded at all NWS and most USAF and FAA WSR-88D sites. From the Level II quantities, computer processing generates numerous meteorological analysis Level III products. The Level III data consists of reduced resolution, low-bandwidth, base products as well as many derived, post-processed products. Level III products are recorded at most U.S. sites, though non-US sites do not have Level III products. There are over 40 Level III products available from the NCDC. General products for Level III include the base and composite reflectivity, storm relative velocity, vertical integrated liquid, echo tops and VAD wind profile. Precipitation products for Level III include estimated ground accumulated rainfall amounts for one and three hour periods, storm totals, and digital arrays. Estimates are based on reflectivity to rainfall rate (Z-R) relationships. Overlay products for Level III are alphanumeric data that give detailed information on certain parameters for an identified storm cell. These include storm structure, hail index, mesocyclone identification, tornadic vortex signature, and storm tracking information. Radar messages for Level III are sent by the radar site to users in order to know more about the radar status and special product data. NEXRAD data are provided to the NOAA National Climatic Data Center for archiving and dissemination to users. Data coverage varies by station and ranges from May 1992 to 1 day from present. Most stations began observing in the mid-1990s, and most period of records are continuous.",

The ISH dataset includes global data obtained from the USAF Climatology Center, located in the Federal Climate Complex with NCDC. The latest daily summary data are normally available 1-2 days after the date-time of the observations used in the daily summaries. The online data files begin with 1929 and are at the time of this writing at the Version 8 software level. Over 9000 stations' data are typically available. The daily elements included in the dataset (as available from each station) are: Mean temperature (.1 Fahrenheit) Mean dew point (.1 Fahrenheit) Mean sea level pressure (.1 mb) Mean station pressure (.1 mb) Mean visibility (.1 miles) Mean wind speed (.1 knots) Maximum sustained wind speed (.1 knots) Maximum wind gust (.1 knots) Maximum temperature (.1 Fahrenheit) Minimum temperature (.1 Fahrenheit) Precipitation amount (.01 inches) Snow depth (.1 inches) Indicator for occurrence of: Fog, Rain or Drizzle, Snow or Ice Pellets, Hail, Thunder, Tornado/Funnel Cloud Global summary of day data for 18 surface meteorological elements are derived from the synoptic/hourly observations contained in USAF DATSAV3 Surface data and Federal Climate Complex Integrated Surface Hourly (ISH). Historical data are generally available for 1929 to the present, with data from 1973 to the present being the most complete. For some periods, one or more countries' data may not be available due to data restrictions or communications problems. In deriving the summary of day data, a minimum of 4 observations for the day must be present (allows for stations which report 4 synoptic observations/day). Since the data are converted to constant units (e.g, knots), slight rounding error from the originally reported values may occur (e.g, 9.9 instead of 10.0). The mean daily values described below are based on the hours of operation for the station. For some stations/countries, the visibility will sometimes 'cluster' around a value (such as 10 miles) due to the practice of not reporting visibilities greater than certain distances. The daily extremes and totals--maximum wind gust, precipitation amount, and snow depth--will only appear if the station reports the data sufficiently to provide a valid value. Therefore, these three elements will appear less frequently than other values. Also, these elements are derived from the stations' reports during the day, and may comprise a 24-hour period which includes a portion of the previous day. The data are reported and summarized based on Greenwich Mean Time (GMT, 0000Z - 2359Z) since the original synoptic/hourly data are reported and based on GMT.",

   "The North America Regional Reanalysis (NARR) Project is a reanalysis of historical observations using a 32-km version of the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) 1993 operational ETA model and ETA data assimilation system (EDAS). The objective is to create a long-term set of consistent climate data on a regional scale for the North American domain. The domain of analyses includes North and Central America as well as small parts of the United Kingdom, Eastern Asia, South America, and areas of the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. The period of the reanalyses is from October 1978 to the present and analyses were made 8 times daily (3 hour intervals). Horizontal boundary conditions are derived from the NCEP/DOE Global Reanalysis. Advantages over the widely used NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis (180 km) are its higher spatial and temporal resolutions (32 km grid, 45 vertical layers, every three hours) and better treatment of the land surface. This is achieved through the use of a better land-surface model (Noah LSM), the assimilation of more observational data (precipitation, upper air and surface winds), and through a better representation of the terrain (heights, vegetation, soil type). This data set contains \"conventional\" atmospheric analyses as well as model-derived fields that contain estimates of subsurface, surface, and radiative properties. This data set is encoded in WMO GRIB format version 1 using the NCEP GRIB table 131. The model used a native, \"E-grid\" for its calculations, however data were interpolated to a Lambert Conformal Conic projection, also known as NAM 221 AWIPS Grid - High Resolution North American Master Grid (32-km Resolution). All vector components are earth relative rather than grids relative which is the convention for operational NCEP model. The list of fields produced by the NARR ETA model differ from the operational ETA model. NARR data files that are compatible with the Grid Analysis and Display System (GrADS) are available.",

It is not broken down into individual lots, for instance lots 4 & 5, Forest Grove Subdivision may comprise one taxable parcel and the Lot line between lots 4 & 5 is not contained in this database. The database encompasses all the area within Montana. At this time, the Data is in an ArcSde/Oracle geodatabase. Each county is available for download as a single ArcGIS personal geodatabase or shapefile. The data is maintained by the MT Department of Revenue (DOR) or in cases of Silver Bow, Cascade, Missoula, Lake, Flathead and Yellowstone counties that are maintained by the individual counties. The data is integrated by Montana State Library Geographic Information Services staff. Each parcel contains an attribute called ParcelID (geocode) that is the parcel identifier. It relates to the geocode in the DOR's Orion database (Computer Assisted Mass Appraisal data - CAMA). Most of the ancillary attribute information is held in this database. Information such as owner name, legal description, and appraised value as well as structural and agricultural data are available within CAMA. SQL Server Express 2000 R2 database files of individual county CAMA data are available for download at the project website listed above. In addition, a SQL Server Express database of selected attributes is available for the entire state. Parcel data is built upon the USDI Bureau of Land Management's (BLM) Geographic Coordinate Database (GCDB). The GCDB is a complex measurement management system that uses a least squares adjustment of existing survey data to come up with a digital representation of the Public Land Survey System (PLSS). For more information on GCDB you should proceed to the Montana/North Dakota BLM website at",
   ". Accuracy varies between townships and it is important to note that the accuracy of the parcel data can't be any more accurate than the GCDB.",

   "The National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) established the Coastal-Marine Automated Network (C-MAN) for the National Weather Service in the early 1980's. NDBC has installed approximately 50 C-MAN stations on lighthouses, at capes and beaches, on near shore islands, and on offshore platforms. NDBC has also deployed over 100 moored (a.k.a., weather) buoys in coastal and offshore waters from the western Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean around Hawaii, and from the Bering Sea to the South Pacific. C-MAN and moored buoy data typically include barometric pressure, wind direction, speed and gust, and air temperature; however, some C-MAN stations are equipped to also measure seawater temperature, water level, waves, and relative humidity. Moored buoys measure wave energy spectra from which NDBC derives significant wave height, dominant wave period, and average wave period. In addition, many moored buoys measure the direction of wave propagation. In collaboration, NDBC and the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) -- formerly the National Oceanographic Data Center (NODC) -- are archiving these data from C-MAN and moored buoys. This collection is part of the collaboration and it contains both NODC F291 and netCDF (version 4) files with data collected from February 1970 through the present day.",

   "The World Ocean Database (WOD) is the world's largest publicly available uniform format quality controlled ocean profile dataset. Ocean profile data are sets of measurements of an ocean variable vs. depth at a single geographic location within a short (minutes to hours) temporal period in some portion of the water column from the surface to the bottom. To be considered a profile for the WOD, there must be more than a single depth/variable pair. Multiple profiles at the same location from the same set of instruments is an oceanographic cast. Ocean variables in the WOD include temperature, salinity, oxygen, nutrients, tracers, and biological variables such as plankton and chlorophyll. Quality control procedures are documented and performed on each cast and the results are included as flags on each measurement. The WOD contains the data on the originally measured depth levels (observed) and also interpolated to standard depth levels to present a more uniform set of iso-surfaces for oceanographic and climate work.",
   "The source of the WOD is more than 20,000 separate archived data sets contributed by institutions, project, government agencies, and individual investigators from the United States and around the world. Each data set is available in its original form in the National Centers for Environmental Information data archives. All data sets are converted to the same standard format, checked for duplication within the WOD, and assigned quality flags based on objective tests. Additional subjective flags are set upon calculation of ocean climatological mean fields which make up the World Ocean Atlas (WOA) series.",
   "The WOD consists of periodic major releases and quarterly updates to those releases. Each major release is associated with a concurrent release of a WOA release, and contains final quality control flags used in the WOA, which includes manual as well as automated steps. Each quarterly update release includes additional historical and recent data and preliminary quality control. The latest major release was WOD 2018 (WOD18), which includes nearly 16 million oceanographic casts, from the second voyage of Captain Cook (1772) to the modern Argo floats (end of 2017).",
